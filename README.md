👋 Hey there! My name is Naomi Rue Golding, a Python developer and founder of [DeepGHS](https://github.com/deepghs), building open-source infrastructure for anime-tech enthusiasts. I obsess over:  

🔧 **Data pipelines** (crawling/cleaning *massive* anime datasets)  
🎨 **Anime image processing** (tools like [imgutils](https://github.com/deepghs/imgutils) & [waifuc](https://github.com/deepghs/waifuc))  
🤖 **AI tooling** (HuggingFace utilities, Stable Diffusion evaluation)  

My repos focus on making anime R&D 10x easier through battle-tested libraries. As a PhD-turned-otaku-engineer 🐭, I lead our non-profit community in creating:  
🌟 Multimodal datasets | 🌟 Anime-specific AI models | 🌟 Dev tools with *actual* weeb UX  

Let’s connect if you breathe anime-tech! 🔗 [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/deepghs) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/EAW4WqFdKY) | [My Email](mailto:narugo1992@deepghs.org)
